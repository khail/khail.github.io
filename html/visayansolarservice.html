                "My career in solar spans 28 years. Mostly in Hawaii which has so many similarities to the Philippines. Augusto Tebio is a master electrical engineer and a man I can trust. He was the first to install a large-scale solar project in Foundation University years ago consisting of 160 solar panels.There is a right way and a wrong way to install solar electric. Augusto knows the right way and will promptly stop any wrong or half-way measures of an installation. Substandard work only creates a bad work environment and can only hurt the finished product. That’s why we partner so well—we both understand this basic tenet of contracting.

                    Top tier panels are of a certain quality that allows import and export internationally. These panels have 25 year warranties (80% of original output) and are used in large scale utility projects (solar farms) as well as residential. Any attempt to “sell” solar based on professed “better” panel is a sales pitch and should be avoided. There are certain situations that paying a significant premium for a more efficient panel makes sense. For instance, when your electric bill is very high but your available roof space is small. Otherwise, why pay more for the same product-electricity. There is no better form of electricity to speak of—it is what it is.
                    <br><br>
                    Buy top tier panels. Many have warranties underwritten by large insurance firms (such as AIG) to guarantee the 25 year coverage.

            <br>
            This inverter technology has progressed for over 60 years and is used exclusively in commercial application as well as residential. The efficiency of inverting DC to AC is approximately 95% high.
            <br><br>
            These inverters harvest more solar energy than any other type of inverter. They are proven and reliable. A typical central inverter could last 15-20 years and be replaced at an affordable cost. Unlike micro inverters, the system array or panels do not need to be disassembled to repair or replace the inverter.

            <br><br>
            The inverter is very small and each panel has one. The sales pitch is that if one fails “the rest still work.” From vast experience I can tell you that you will spend the rest of your life replacing them one after the other. Replacing a defective micro inverter (basically a toy) is very time consuming and expensive. Yes, they may offer a “great” warranty, but taking apart the system to reach the “broken” inverter is a labor nightmare. Micro inverters have a much lower rate of inverting DC to AC. Approximately 86-88% inversion as compared to the 95% of central inverters. 
            <br><br>
            From my experience, they are a cheap way to install. The installer saves money while having a great sales pitch. “Every panel has one.” And every one will fail in due time. Good luck getting your installer to continue to replace them month after month.

                    There is a solar company born every day. The economic driver that is solar is taking over the world’s energy market. The drive is money. That’s fine if you’re selling fashion, or diet supplements, but we in the industry require license, experience, electrical proficiency, and safety.
                    <br><br>
                    Did you know that solar installation is 70% roof penetration and waterproofing?  
                    <br><br>
                    Professional companies “respect the roof.” Startup companies “respect the profit.”
                    <br><br>
                    All roof types require a different approach to guarantee a waterproof installation. Saving money on the electric bill is wonderful, but not to the expense of a leaking roof.
                    <br><br>
                    We stand behind our workmanship and experience. We offer a FIVE YEAR WORKMANSHIP WARRANTY.
                    <br><br>
                    For those who don’t know, this is primarily a waterproofing warranty—Very important!
                    <br><br>
                    Typically, if you use a central inverter you will have zero problems with the function of your P.V. solar. Cleaning of panels is recommended at least 2 times per year using water and broom.
                    <br><br>
                    However, the integrity of your roof penetration is of utmost concern. 
                    <br><br>
                    Final advice—use a professional, not a marketing company.
                    <br><br><br>
                    <strong>PLEASE NOTE: YOUR WORKMANSHIP WARRANTY IS ONLY AS GOOD AS YOUR INSTALLER. USE A PROVEN CONTRACTOR.</strong>

                Solar panels are a simple yet very effective way to make  your own electricity and save millions of pesos over the years.

                <br><br>
                The Return on Investment is only 4 to 5 years!

                <br><br>
                These systems include panels, Installation Racking, and an inverter system to change the DC (Direct Current) produced by the panel into AC (Alternating Current) used in our grid. There is also monitoring to know “exactly” how much electricity is being generated.

                <br><br>
                Since these systems generate electricity only during daylight hours, your property will still be connected to the utility service in your area. Batteries will become affordable to use with these systems in approximately 3 to 4 years.
